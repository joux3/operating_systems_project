Assignment 1

1. Changed files
    - kernel/exception.c
    - proc/exception.c
    - vm/tlb.c
    - vm/tlb.h
    - vm/vm.c
    - vm/thread.c

2. Description of the solution
    - we removed the naive tlb_fill usage
    - we improved the userland and kernel exception handlers
        - first of all, remove the placeholder kernel panics
        - implement functions to handle the tlb exceptions
    - in the case of tlb modification, mark the appropriate pages dirty (in the tlb and in
      the physical pagetable)
    - in the case of tlb miss (read or write) we go to the page table of the current thread
      and try inserting that to the tlb
        - if the address cannot be found, panic the kernel (if thread running in kernel mode)
          or kill the process (if the thread running as an userland process or we are copying
          from or to kernel)
    - write to the tlb randomly (since we don't have enough room to store LRU information in
      the MIPS architecture)
    - when a thread finishes, remove all the threads markings from the tlb

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - the solution is simple enough and fulfills the criteria of the assignment

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
