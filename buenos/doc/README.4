Assignment 1

1. Changed files
    - kernel/exception.c
    - proc/exception.c
    - vm/tlb.c
    - vm/tlb.h
    - vm/vm.c
    - kernel/thread.c
    - proc/process.c (removed tlb_fill usage)

2. Description of the solution
    - we removed the naive tlb_fill usage
    - we improved the userland and kernel exception handlers
        - first of all, remove the placeholder kernel panics
        - implement functions to handle the tlb exceptions
    - in the case of tlb modification, mark the appropriate pages dirty (in the tlb and in
      the physical pagetable)
    - in the case of tlb miss (read or write) we go to the page table of the current thread
      and try inserting that to the tlb
        - if the address cannot be found, panic the kernel (if thread running in kernel mode)
          or kill the process (if the thread running as an userland process or we are copying
          from or to kernel)
    - write to the tlb randomly (since we don't have enough room to store LRU information in
      the MIPS architecture)
    - when a thread finishes, remove all the threads markings from the tlb

    NOTE: the initial implementation was based on the pre virtual memory implementation, and
          most of the logic was rewritten when the paging was implemented.

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - the solution is simple enough and fulfills the criteria of the assignment

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - none

Assignment 2

1. Changed files
    - kernel/exception.c
    - proc/exception.c
    - proc/process.c
    - proc/syscall.c
    - vm/tlb.c
    - vm/tlb.h

    - vm/vm.h
    - vm/pagetable.h
    - kernel/thread.c

2. Description of the solution
    - for the paging we implemented a virtual pagepool on top of the physical pagepool already
      present in the BUENOS source code
    - in practice this is done with two tables (one that holds information about all the virtual
      pages and one that holds information of all the virtual pages that are currently in memory)
        - the first table is the page entry table and the second one the physical page table
        - the index of the page entry table also corresponds to the location on the swap disk
    - the structures in these tables contain other information as well, such as are the pages
      dirty and when they were last accessed
    - there's a swap disk that has blocks the size of a page
    - during the initialization of the virtual memory system we reserve half of the physical
      pagepool pages for the paging system
    - when requesting a virtual page, we seek an empty slot in the virtual page table and mark
      the corresponding place occupied in the swap disk (if no free slots, return error)
    - storing the latest access to the page is used to implement the LRU replacement policy,
      which is simple but works just fine
    - in the case of tlb miss (read or write)
        - if the virtual page is already in memory, put the physical address in the tlb
        - if not, fetch the address from the physical page table (and swap out the oldest entry,
          if the desired address is not found) and put the acquired address to the tlb
        - in the case of store miss, mark the physical page dirty
    - if we encounter a tlb modify, mark the physical page dirty and update the access time
    - when swapping out pages, only write things to disk if the page is marked dirty

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - building on top of the existing page pool made the implementation simpler

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - our plan didn't include the write protected status for pages, but we added it to
      support read-only pages

Assignment 3

1. Changed files
    - tests/lib.c
    - tests/lib.h
    - proc/syscall.c

2. Description of the solution
    - the memlimit syscall is implemented as follows
        - when a process starts, store the highest used memory region
        - when userland queries for a new memlimit
            - if more memory is queried, move memlimit forwards and reserve necessary
              virtual pages
            - if lesser memory is queried, free virtual pages if possible
        - kernel will always reserve full pages, but the user asked memlimit is nevertheless
          returned to the user and not the ends of the pages
    - the malloc and free are heap based
    - for the malloc and free, there's an allocated structure that tells the size of an
      allocated area and if it's been deleted
    - the malloc is implemented as follows
        - go through all the allocated areas
        - if there is a big enough allocated area that is marked deleted, take an
          appropriately sized chunk from it and allocate that (the rest remains marked
          deleted)
        - if there is no appropriate area, increase the heap size and create a new area
    - free is implemented as follows
        - find the allocated structure of the desired area
        - mark the area deleted
        - if there are consecutive deleted areas from the just deleted area to the top of
          the heap, lower the top of the heap (thus freeing the space)
                

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - simple is good

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - none
