Assignment 1
1. Changed files
    - excepption.c (excepction handling to userland processes in order to prevent
      constant kernel panics)
    - thread.c/h (added the flags that signify that copying between kernel and
      userland is in process)
    - process.c/h (functions to do the actual copying between kernel and userland)


2. Description of the solution
    - the solution works as follows (for copying both certain length strings and blocks
      of predefined size)
        - get the current thread entry
        - decide which way we are copying (kernel -> userland or userland -> kernel)
        - assert that we are currently not copying
        - put up the flag that tells that copying in process
        - then, for each byte to be copied, check that the userland pointer is in a
          userland legal region (userland mapped memory)
            - if it is, copy the byte and process the next byte
            - if it's not, put down the copying flag and return an error
            - if an error has occured at some point, also put down the copy flag
              and return error
        - finally, if all went well, return the amount of bytes copied

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - the solution aims for simplicity and throroughness, and checking every byte seems
      like the way to do it

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - None

Assignment 2

1. Changed files
    - process.c/h contains the tables and data structures for this assignment

2. Description of the solution
    - in this assignment we have implemented two data structures for the processes - 
      one table for process entries and one table for filehandles
    - both tables are protected with a lock in order to satisfy the synchronization
      requirement ofthe assignment
    - the size of the filehandle table is capped by the maximum number of open files
    - the size of the process table is capped at 64
    - the process entry stores:
        - the name of the process (executable name + where it's found on the file system)
        - process state (free, running, zombie), where free signifies that the entry is free
        - the process id of the parent
        - return value of the process
    - the filehandle entry contains:
        - flag telling if the entry is in use
        - the owner of the entry
        - the openfile_t identifier of of the file in the filesystem
    - there's also a condition variable that is used to put the processes that are waiting for
      their children to sleep, but more on that in syscall_join

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - tables with locks are the simplest synchronized data structures

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - none

Assignment 3

Of note: this assignemnt is the big one on this round, so the following wall of text will be the
longest yet.

1. Changed files
    - the system calls are implemented in proc/syscall.c
    - process.c/h are also modified in order to accomodate the safe copying
      of parameters between userland and kernel and and passing parameters to processes
      (in practice, the process_start() has been split to process_start() ans process_init()
      and modified such that it accpets parameters)

2. Description of the solution
    - let's go through the syscalls one by one
    
    - since we implemented the argument augmented processes, the processes are started with
      the execp function
    - syscall_execp(filename, argcount, aruments):
        - copy the filename to kernel (using the safe copy mechanism)
        - if the copying failed (nothing was copied, a bad pointer was given or too many
          arguments were supplied), return error (and in case of the bad pointer, exit the
          process)
        - copy the argument pointer to the kernel (there is always at least one argument, which is
          the name of the executable file)
        - if invalid pointers are supplied, exit the process
        - then copy the arguments kernel, as pointed out by the argument pointer and the amount
          of arguments (and some sweet pointer arithmetic!)
        - again, in case of illegal pointers, exit the process and in case of failed copies return
          a note of that
        - after everything is safely copied to the kernel, call process start with the arguments

    - syscall_join(int process_id):
        - validate the process id
        - if invalid, return error code
        - lock the process table
        - check that there is a process in the process table with the given id and that that process
          is this process' child
        - if not, return error code
        - wait for the condition variable that tells that a process has become a zombie
            - if the process we are joining with is no longer running, free up the process table entry
              and get the return value from the child
            - otherwise wait more
        - rekease the process table lock and return the result

    - syscall_exit(int return_value):
        - get the current process
        - lock the filehandle table
        - close the filehandles associated with this process and free the filehandle table entries
        - release the filehandle lock
        - lock the process table
        - set the return value of the process
        - set the process state to zombie
        - go clean out the zombie children from the process table
        - release the process table lock
        - broadcast the zombie condtition variable (so that the processes joining to this process can
          exit)
        - clean up the pagetable and free the physical pages associated to the process
        - call thread finish

    - syscall_open(filename):
        - copy the filename to the kernel (check for errors, return error codes if necessary and all that
          jazz)
        - aquire the filehandle table lock
        - find the first free entry in the filehandle table
        - if no free entries, return error code
        - open the file (with the filesystem's function)
        - if opening succeeded, populate the filehandle table entry
        - if not, return error code
        - finally, increment the processes filehandle by 3 (handles 0-2 are for standard streams)
        - release the filehandle table lock
        - return the filehandle (or error code)

    - syscall_close(filehandle)
        - lock the filehandle table
        - decrement the filehandle by 3 (again, handles 0-2 reserved)
        - validate the filehandle
        - check that the filehandle is in use and is owned by the current process
        - if all good, use the filesystem's function to close the file
        - mark the filehandle table entry free
        - release the lock
        - return the result (negative on error)

    - syscall_seek():
        - seek is exactly the same as close, but instead of close we call the seek
          function of the filesystem
