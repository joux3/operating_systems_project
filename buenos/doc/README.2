Assignment 1
1. Changed files
    - excepption.c (excepction handling to userland processes in order to prevent
      constant kernel panics)
    - thread.c/h (added the flags that signify that copying between kernel and
      userland is in process)
    - process.c/h (functions to do the actual copying between kernel and userland)


2. Description of the solution
    - the solution works as follows (for copying both certain length strings and blocks
      of predefined size)
        - get the current thread entry
        - decide which way we are copying (kernel -> userland or userland -> kernel)
        - assert that we are currently not copying
        - put up the flag that tells that copying in process
        - then, for each byte to be copied, check that the userland pointer is in a
          userland legal region (userland mapped memory)
            - if it is, copy the byte and process the next byte
            - if it's not, put down the copying flag and return an error
            - if an error has occured at some point, also put down the copy flag
              and return error
        - finally, if all went well, return the amount of bytes copied

3. Motivation behind the solution
    - the solution aims for simplicity and throroughness, and checking every byte seems
      like the way to do it

4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - None
