Assignment 3

1. Changed files
    - fs/sfs.c
    - fs/sfs.h
2. Description of the solution
    - each file can have both direct and indirect data blocks associated with it
    - indirect blocks contain links to data blocks or other indirect blocks
    - file inodes have support for multiple direct data blocks, one single indirect
      data block, one double indirect data block and one triple indirect data block
      (for example double indirect data block link in a file links to a block that 
      links to a block that contains links to actual data blocks)
3. Motivation behind the solution
    - supporting files up to 1 megabyte in size requires a file structure, that can
      refer to 8192 different 128-byte-size disk blocks. the presented solution is a
      simple way to achieve that and it doesn't waste too much space as the indirect
      blocks are only used when needed
4. Changes to the plan presented in the review session
    - none
