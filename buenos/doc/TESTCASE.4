  ----------
  Testcase bigbinary.c
  ----------

  This testcase tests the paging and virtual memory by creating a large
  array and accessing it. The entire array shouldn't fit the memory and
  the accesses should cause TLB misses, thus veryfing that the TLB and
  paging implementations work.

  The test is located in tests/bigbinary.c

  And it can be run from the shell with [test]bigbinary command.

  Here's an example output.
